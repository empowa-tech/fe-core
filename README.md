# Empowa Styles
Setup design tokens which will be used to setup MUI themes.

## Important notice
We use the Material UI (MUI) components library for React.

This only works with
- MUI
- React
- Typescript
- Figma
- Figma plugin: Design Tokens

## MUI
Mui is a component library for React.

# Figma
In order to make this work, you need to own the official [MUI for Figma](https://mui.com/store/items/figma-react/) license, so you can use the Figma file.
The file contains all the components, icons and variables. 
You can change all the variables in this file to your own preference.

# Design Tokens for Figma plugin
With the [Design Tokens](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/888356646278934516/design-tokens) plugin you can import all Figma variables and export them as Design Tokens. 
It comes with a feature to directly push it to a Github repository in a separate branch.


## Design Tokens
Design tokens are pushed from Figma to a separate branch.
It uses [Style Dictionary]() to translate design tokens to JS / CSS Variables.
These variables are imported and used in __Material UI Theme Config file__.
